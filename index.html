  <h3>Education</h3>
  <ul type="bullet">
    <li>
      <strong>D.A.V Public School NTS Barkakana</strong>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>
          It is the best school in my locality, affiliated to <a href="https://www.cbse.gov.in/">CBSE</a> board and was established in 1986. <br />I completed my SSC over there with a CGPA of 9.0 .
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Sri Chaitanya Satyam Campus, Boyepalem Vishakhapatnam</strong>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>
          It is a residential school, affiliated to<a href="https://www.cbse.gov.in/"> CBSE</a> board and which was rumored to be providing highrer education with IIT coaching. <br />I completed my HSC over there with a percentage of 79.6 and made
          some everlasting memories and some very
          great friends who will stay with me forever.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>Aurora's Degree and PG College, Hyderabad</strong>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li>
          It is a day scholar college, affiliated to <a href="https://www.osmania.ac.in/">Osmania University</a>, an average college I would say. <br />I completed my degree over there with a CGPA of 8.74.<br />It was a bit rough following a routine
          of a boy going to study 50km's and coming
          back.<br />I've to admit the travelling was tiring and it took much time of my day than any other task I did and the language difference was not much of an obstacle as I made some really fine friends and priceless memories with
          them.<br />The city of Hyderabad and its people and all the hustling and bustling made me the man what I am now as it was the first time I had experienced a wave of change in my emotions. Oh! I really miss the Biriyani. <br /><em>"Tvaralō
